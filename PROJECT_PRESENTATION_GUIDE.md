## 🎭 PART 7: Animation Consistency

Your site uses **Anime.js** and **GSAP ScrollTrigger**. Here's how I'll maintain consistency:

### **Existing Animation Patterns (from your code):**

1. **Hover Effects:**
   - Scale: `1` → `1.05-1.1`
   - Duration: `300ms`
   - Easing: `out(2)` or `out(3)`

2. **Scroll Reveals:**
   - translateY: `30px` → `0`
   - opacity: `0` → `1`
   - Stagger delay: `150ms`
   - Easing: `outExpo`

3. **Color Transitions:**
   - Duration: `300-400ms`
   - Easing: `inOutQuad`

### **New Animations I'll Add:**

1. **Project Card Entrance:**
   - Initial: `opacity: 0, translateX: 100px`
   - Animate: `opacity: 1, translateX: 0`
   - Trigger: ScrollTrigger when 70% in viewport
   - Stagger: 200ms between projects

2. **Mockup Hover:**
   - Scale: `1` → `1.02`
   - Box-shadow enhancement
   - Border glow increase

3. **Link Button Hover:**
   - Icon: rotate and translate
   - Background: subtle color shift
   - Scale: `1` → `1.05`

4. **GIF/Video Container:**
   - Subtle floating animation
   - Pause on hover for clarity
